# Generation brief: task N06

You are writing synthetic **evaluation items** for a text classifier. Every item has a PRE-ASSIGNED
ground-truth label. Your job is to write the text so that a careful expert would assign exactly that label.

## The task
- Domain: emails received by an employee (sender, subject, body)
- Question that will be asked about each text: "Is this email a phishing attempt?"
- Label values (as they appear in the plan) and their meaning:
- `true` → Tries to trick the recipient into revealing credentials, paying, opening a malicious link/attachment, or impersonates someone
- `false` → Legitimate email, even if urgent or promotional
- Task-specific notes: Use fictional companies and domains. near_miss: legitimate urgent security notice that asks nothing sensitive (false) vs lookalike sender domain (true). distractor: phishing email with a calm professional tone, or a legit email using words like 'verify'.

## Plan
`data/plan/N06.jsonl` has 56 rows. Each row fixes: `label`, `difficulty`, `hard_type`, `length`,
`subtopic` (the situation to write about; invent everything else) and `writer` (persona/style; may be null).

Difficulty:
- **easy**: The label is obvious: explicit, typical cues that any reader would recognise.
- **medium**: The label must be inferred from context. Avoid the most obvious keywords and never use the label name itself.
- **hard**: Hard case of the row's hard_type (see 'Hard types' below). The label must STILL be unambiguous to a careful expert reader.

Hard types used in this task:
- **distractor**: Prominently mention a cue that belongs to a different label, but make the correct label clearly the main point.
- **implicit**: No explicit keywords at all; the label is only inferable from indirect, concrete details.
- **near_miss**: Almost qualifies for the opposite label but differs in one crucial detail.

Length:
- **long**: ~180-350 words.
- **medium**: 3-6 sentences (~50-120 words).
- **short**: 1-2 sentences (at most ~40 words).

## Hard rules
1. The assigned label must be clearly the best answer for a careful expert, including hard items. Hard means
   "requires care", never "ambiguous". If a hard_type would make the item ambiguous, adjust it until it isn't.
2. In medium and hard items never use the label name or copy the label description. Never add meta-commentary
   about the label (e.g. "this is a billing issue").
3. Everything is fictional: invent names, companies, places, numbers. No real people, brands or tickers.
4. English only. Make every item distinct: vary names, openings, structure and details; do not reuse templates.
5. The `state` of each item is a plain string.

## Output
Write `data/raw/N06.jsonl` with one JSON object per line, `{"id": ..., "state": ...}`, for EVERY plan row, in
plan order. Work in batches of about 15 items: after each batch, APPEND its lines to the file with a small python3
script using `json.dumps` (avoids escaping errors), so progress is saved. If the file already exists when you start,
keep the items in it and continue from the first plan id that is missing. When all rows are written, run
`python3 build.py check-raw N06` and fix anything it reports. Finish with a one-line summary.
Apart from your plan file and your output file, do not read or write anything in `data/`.
